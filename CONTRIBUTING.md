## Learn & listen

* Mailing list: [circuits-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/circuits-dev)
* IRC channel: [#circuits](https://web.libera.chat/#circuits)
	           on the [Libera.Chat IRC Network](https://libera.chat/) (``irc.libera.chat:6697`` TLS).\
* Blog: [James Mills circuits Blog](http://shortcircuit.net.au/~prologic/blog/tag/circuits/)

## Adding new features

Got a great new feature you'd like to add? Great! First let's discuss it either on
the [#circuits](https://web.libera.chat/#circuits) IRC Channel
or create a new [Discussion Issue](https://github.com/circuits/circuits/issues/new).

Once we're all on the same page and we've nutted down the design and requirements together
let's get you hacking and take ownership of the new feature!

* [Fork circuits](https://github.com/circuits/circuits/issues/14#fork-destination-box)
* Clone your newly created fork:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:myuser/circuits.git
```

* Create a new feature branch:

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-feature master
```

* Hack on your feature with your favorite editor or IDE!
* Commit and Push your changes up:

```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "my fancy new feature. Closes #xx"
$ git push -u origin my-feature
```

* Create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/circuits/circuits/compare/)

That's it! Six easy steps to contributing a new feature!

Generally we'll respond pretty quickly to new issues, pull requests and general
discussions on IRC. So come and join us!

# Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Great! We wants to help fix it!

* File a new [Bug Report](https://github.com/circuits/circuits/issues/new)
* Label it as a "Bug"

When describing your bug report; please be concise and as detailed as you can
so we can easily work out what the problem is. It's also very helpful if you
are able to provide a test case that repeatedly demonstrates the bug at hand:

Example:

```python
from circuits import Event, Component


class test(Event):
    """test Event"""


class App(Component):

	message = None

    def started(self):
		self.message = "Hello World!"
		self.stop()


def test():
	App().run()

	assert app.message == "Hello World!"
```

Obviously this test *would pass* but this is ideally what we'd like to see bug reports in the
form of; a reliable, repeatable way of demonstrating the bug.

If you don't feel comfortable writing a test case; a good description is enough!
(*We'll take care of the hard work of ensuring the bug never occurs again!*)
