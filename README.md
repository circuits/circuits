Installation
============

The simplest and recommended way to install circuits is with pip. You may install the latest stable release from PyPI with pip:

    > pip install circuits

If you do not have pip, you may use easy\_install:

    > easy_install circuits

Alternatively, you may download the source package from the [PyPi Page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/circuits) or the [Downloads Page](https://bitbucket.org/circuits/circuits/downloads) extract it and install using:

    > python setup.py install

> **note**
>
> You can install the [development version](https://bitbucket.org/circuits/circuits/get/tip.tar.gz#egg=circuits-dev)  
> via `pip install circuits==dev`.
