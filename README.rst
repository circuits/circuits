circuits is a **Lightweight** **Event** driven and **Asynchronous**
**Application Framework** for the
`Python Programming Language <http://www.python.org/>`_ with a
strong **Component** Architecture. circuits also includes a lightweight,
high performance and scalable HTTP/WSGI web server
(*with some similar features to* `CherryPy <http://www.cherrypy.org/>`_)
as well as various I/O and Networking components.

circuits has a clean architecture and has no required external dependencies.
It has a small footprint and delivers a powerful set of features for building
large, scalable, maintainable applications and systems. circuits comes with a
suite of standard components that can be quickly utilized to create
applications from a simple tool to a complex distributed web application.
