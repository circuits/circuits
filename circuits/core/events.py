        """An event is a message send to one or more channels.
        It is eventually dispatched to all components
        that have handlers for one of the channels and the event type.

        All normal arguments and keyword arguments passed to the constructor
        of an event are passed on to the handler. When declaring a
        handler, its argument list must therefore match the arguments
        used for creating the event.

        Every event has a :attr:`name` attribute that is used for matching
        the event with the handlers.

        :cvar channels: an optional attribute that may be set before firing
            the event. If defined (usually as a class variable), the attribute
            specifies the channels that the event should be delivered
            to as a tuple. This overrides the default behavior
            of sending the event to the firing component's channel.

            When an event is fired, the value in this attribute
            is replaced for the instance with the channels that
            the event is actually sent to. This information may be used
            e.g. when the event is passed as a parameter to a handler.

        :ivar value: this is a :class:`circuits.core.values.Value`
            object that holds the results returned by the handlers invoked
            for the event.

        :var success: if this optional attribute is set to
            ``True``, an associated event ``success`` (original name
            with "_success" appended) will automatically be fired when all
            handlers for the event have been invoked successfully.

        :var success_channels: the success event is, by default, delivered
            to same channels as the successfully dispatched event itself.
            This may be overridden by specifying an alternative list of
            destinations using this attribute.

        :var complete: if this optional attribute is set to
            ``True``, an associated event ``complete`` (original name
            with "_complete" appended) will automatically be fired when all
            handlers for the event and all events fired by these handlers
            (recursively) have been invoked successfully.

        :var complete_channels: the complete event is, by default, delivered
            to same channels as the initially dispatched event itself.
            This may be overridden by specifying an alternative list of
            destinations using this attribute.
