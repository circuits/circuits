class Manager(object):

    """
    The manager class has two roles. As a base class for component
    implementation, it provides methods for event and handler management.
    The method :meth:`.fireEvent` appends a new event at the end of the event
    queue for later execution. :meth:`.waitEvent` suspends the execution
    of a handler until all handlers for a given event have been invoked.
    :meth:`.callEvent` combines the last two methods in a single method.

    The methods :meth:`.addHandler` and :meth:`.removeHandler` allow handlers
    for events to be added and removed dynamically. (The more common way to
    register a handler is to use the :func:`~.handlers.handler` decorator
    or derive the class from :class:`~.components.Component`.)

    In its second role, the :class:`.Manager` takes the role of the
    event executor. Every component hierarchy has a root component that
    maintains a queue of events. Firing an event effectively means
    appending it to the event queue maintained by the root manager.
    The :meth:`.flush` method removes all pending events from the
    queue and, for each event, invokes all the handlers. Usually,
    :meth:`.flush` is indirectly invoked by :meth:`run`.

    The manager optionally provides information about the execution of
    events as automatically generated events. If an :class:`~.events.Event`
    has its :attr:`success` attribute set to True, the manager fires
    a :class:`~.events.Success` event if all handlers have been
    executed without error. Note that this event will be
    enqueued (and dispatched) immediately after the events that have been
    fired by the event's handlers. So the success event indicates both
    the successful invocation of all handlers for the event and the
    processing of the immediate follow-up events fired by those handlers.

    Sometimes it is not sufficient to know that an event and its
    immediate follow-up events have been processed. Rather, it is
    important to know when all state changes triggered by an event,
    directly or indirectly, have been performed. This also includes
    the processing of events that have been fired when invoking
    the handlers for the follow-up events and the processing of events
    that have again been fired by those handlers and so on. The completion
    of the processing of an event and all its direct or indirect
    follow-up events may be indicated by a :class:`~.events.Complete`
    event. This event is generated by the manager if :class:`~.events.Event`
    has its :attr:`complete` attribute set to True.

    Apart from the event queue, the root manager also maintains a list of
    tasks, actually Python generators, that are updated when the event queue
    has been flushed.
