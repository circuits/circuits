"""Workers

Worker components used to perform "work" in independent threads or
processes. Worker(s) are typically used by a Pool (circuits.core.pools)
to create a pool of workers. Worker(s) are not registered with a Manager
or another Component - instead they are managed by the Pool. If a Worker
is used independently it should not be registered as it causes its
main event handler ``_on_task`` to execute in the other thread blocking it.
