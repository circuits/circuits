    """Line Protocol

    Implements the Line Protocol.

    Incoming data is split into lines with a splitter function. For each
    line of data processed a Line Event is created. Any unfinished lines
    are appended into an internal buffer.

    A custom line splitter function can be passed to customize how data
    is split into lines. This function must accept two arguments, the data
    to process and any left over data from a previous invocation of the
    splitter function. The function must also return a tuple of two items,
    a list of lines and any left over data.

    :param splitter: a line splitter function
    :type  splitter: function

    This Component operates in two modes. In normal operation it's expected
    to be used in conjunction with components that expose a Read Event on
    a "read" channel with only one argument (data). Some builtin components
    that expose such events are:
    - circuits.net.sockets.TCPClient
    - circuits.io.File

    The second mode of operation works with circuits.net.sockets.Server
    components such as TCPServer, UNIXServer, etc. It's expected that
    two arguments exist in the Read Event, sock and data. The following
    two arguments can be passed to affect how unfinished data is stored
    and retrieved for such components:

    :param getBuffer: function to retrieve the buffer for a client sock
    :type getBuffer: function

    This function must accept one argument (sock,) the client socket
    whoose buffer is to be retrieved.

    :param updateBuffer: function to update the buffer for a client sock
    :type updateBuffer: function

    This function must accept two arguments (sock, buffer,) the client
    socket and the left over buffer to be updated.

    @note: This Component must be used in conjunction with a Component that
           exposes Read events on a "read" Channel.
