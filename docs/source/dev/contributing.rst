Contributing to circuits
========================

Here's how you can contribute to circuits


Share your story
----------------


One of the best ways you can contribute to circuits is by using circuits.
Share with us your story of how you've used circuits to solve a problem
or create a new software solution using the circuits framework and library
of components.

.. see: http://circuitsframework.com/Community


Submitting Bug Reports
----------------------


We welcome all bug reports. We do however prefer bug reports in a clear
and concise form with repeatable steps. One of the best ways you can report
a bug to us is by writing a unit test (//similar to the ones in our tests//)
so that we can verify the bug, fix it and commit the fix along with the test.

To submit a bug report, please `Create an Issue`_


Writing new tests
-----------------


We're not perfect, and we're still writing more tests to ensure quality code.
If you'd like to help, please `Fork circuits`_, write more tests that cover more
of our code base and submit a `Pull Request`_. Many Thanks!


Adding New Features
-------------------


If you'd like to see a new feature added to circuits, then we'd like to hear
about it~ We would like to see some discussion around any new features as well
as valid use-cases. To start the discussions off, please either:

- `Chat to us on #circuits on the FreeNode IRC Network <http://freenode.org>`_

  or

- `Create an Issue`_
