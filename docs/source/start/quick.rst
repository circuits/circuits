Quick Start Guide
=================


The easiest way to download and install circuits is to use the
`pip`_ command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install circuits


Now that you have successfully downloaded and installed circuits, let's
test that circuits is properly installed and working.

First, let's check the installed version:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import circuits
   >>> print circuits.__version__

This should output:

.. program-output: python -c "import circuits; print circuits.__version__"

Try some of the examples in the examples/ directory shipped with the distribution.

Have fun :)
