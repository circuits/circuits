Tutorial
========


Overview
--------

Welcome to the circuits tutorial. This 5-minute tutorial will guide you
through the basic concepts of circuits. The goal is to introduce
new concepts incrementally with walk-through examples that you can try out!
By the time you've finished, you should have a good basic understanding
of circuits, how it feels and where to go from there.


The Component
-------------

First up, let's show how you can use the ``Component`` and run it in a very
simple application.

.. literalinclude:: 001.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 001.py <001.py>`

Okay so that's pretty boring as it doesn't do very much! But that's okay...
Read on!

Let's try to create our own custom Component called ``MyComponent``. This is done
using normal Python subclassing.

.. literalinclude:: 002.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 002.py <002.py>`

Okay, so this still isn't very useful! But at least we can create
custom components with the behavior we want.

Let's move on to something more interesting...

.. note:: Component(s) in circuits are what sets circuits apart from other Asynchronous or Concurrent
          Application Frameworks. Components(s) are used as building blocks from simple behaviors to
          complex ones (*composition of simpler components to form more complex ones*).


Event Handlers
--------------

Let's now extend our little example to say "Hello World!" when it's started.

.. literalinclude:: 003.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 003.py <003.py>`

Here we've created a simple **Event Handler** that listens for the ``started`` Event.

.. note:: Methods defined in a custom subclassed ``Component`` are automatically turned into
          **Event Handlers**. The only exception to this are methods prefixed with an underscore (``_``).

.. note:: If you do not want this *automatic* behavior, inherit from ``BaseComponent`` instead which means
          you will **have to** use the ``~circuits.core.handlers.handler`` decorator to define
          your **Event Handlers**.

Running this we get::
   
   Hello World!


Alright! We have something slightly more useful! Whoohoo it says hello!

.. note:: Press ^C (*CTRL + C*) to exit.


Registering Components
----------------------

So now that we've learned how to use a Component, create a custom Component
and create simple Event Handlers, let's try something a bit more complex
by creating a complex component made up of two simpler ones.

.. note:: We call this **Component Composition** which is the very essence of the circuits Application Framework.

Let's create two components:

- ``Bob``
- ``Fred``

.. literalinclude:: 004.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 004.py <004.py>`

Notice the way we register the two components ``Bob`` and ``Fred`` together
? Don't worry if this doesn't make sense right now. Think of it as putting
two components together and plugging them into a circuit board.

Running this example produces the following result::
   
   Hello I'm Bob!
   Hello I'm Fred!

Cool! We have two components that each do something and print a simple
message on the screen!


Complex Components
------------------

Now, what if we wanted to create a Complex Component? Let's say we wanted
to create a new Component made up of two other smaller components?

We can do this by simply registering components to a Complex Component
during initialization.

.. note:: This is also called **Component Composition** and avoids the
          classical `Diamond problem <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem>`_
          of Multiple Inheritance. In circuits we do not use Multiple Inheritance to create **Complex Components**
          made up of two or more base classes of components, we instead compose them together via registration.

.. literalinclude:: 005.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 005.py <005.py>`

So now ``Pound`` is a Component that consists of two other components
registered to it: ``Bob`` and ``Fred``

The output of this is identical to the previous::
   
   * <Pound/* 3391:MainThread (queued=0, channels=1, handlers=3) [R]>
    * <Bob/* 3391:MainThread (queued=0, channels=1, handlers=1) [S]>
    * <Fred/* 3391:MainThread (queued=0, channels=1, handlers=1) [S]>
   Hello I'm Bob!
   Hello I'm Fred!
   
The only difference is that ``Bob`` and ``Fred`` are now part of a more
Complex Component called ``Pound``. This can be illustrated by the
following diagram:

.. graphviz::
   
   digraph G {
      "Pound-1344" -> "Bob-9b0c";
      "Pound-1344" -> "Fred-e98a";
   }
   
.. note::
   The extra lines in the above output are an ASCII representation of the
   above graph (*produced by pydot + graphviz*).

Cool :-)


Component Inheritance
---------------------

Since circuits is a framework written for the `Python Programming
Language`_ it naturally inherits properties of Object Orientated
Programming (OOP) -- such as inheritance.

So let's take our ``Bob`` and ``Fred`` components and create a Base
Component called ``Dog`` and modify our two dogs (``Bob`` and ``Fred``) to
subclass this.

.. literalinclude:: 006.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 006.py <006.py>`

Now let's try to run this and see what happens::
   
  Woof! I'm Bob!
  Woof! I'm Fred!

So both dogs barked! Hmmm


Component Channels
------------------

What if we only want one of our dogs to bark? How do we do this without
causing the other one to bark as well?

Easy! Use a separate ``channel`` like so:

.. literalinclude:: 007.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 007.py <007.py>`

.. note::
   Events can be fired with either the ``.fire(...)`` or ``.fireEvent(...)``
   method.

If you run this, you'll get::
   
   Woof! I'm Bob!


Event Objects
-------------

So far in our tutorial we have been defining an Event Handler for a builtin
Event called ``started``. What if we wanted to define our own Event Handlers and our own
Events? You've already seen how easy it is to create a new Event Handler
by simply defining a normal Python method on a Component.

Defining your own Events helps with documentation and testing and makes
things a little easier.

Example::
   
   class MyEvent(Event):
      """MyEvent"""

So here's our example where we'll define a new Event called ``Bark``
and make our ``Dog`` fire a ``Bark`` event when our application starts up.

.. literalinclude:: 008.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 008.py <008.py>`

If you run this, you'll get::
   
   Woof! I'm Bob!
   Woof! I'm Fred!


The Debugger
------------

Lastly...

Asynchronous programming has many advantages but can be a little harder to
write and follow. A silently caught exception in an Event Handler, or an Event
that never gets fired, or any number of other weird things can cause your
application to fail and leave you scratching your head.

Fortunately circuits comes with a ``Debugger`` Component to help you keep
track of what's going on in your application, and allows you to tell what
your application is doing.

Let's say that we defined out ``bark`` Event Handler in our ``Dog``
Component as follows::
   
   def bark(self):
      print("Woof! I'm %s!" % name)

Now clearly there is no such variable as ``name`` in the local scope.

For reference here's the entire example...

.. literalinclude:: 009.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

:download:`Download 009.py <009.py>`

If you run this, you'll get:

That's right! You get nothing! Why? Well in circuits any error or
exception that occurs in a running application is automatically caught and
dealt with in a way that lets your application "keep on going". Crashing is
unwanted behavior in a system so we expect to be able to recover from
horrible situations.

SO what do we do? Well that's easy. circuits comes with a ``Debugger``
that lets you log all events as well as all errors so you can quickly and
easily discover which Event is causing a problem and which Event Handler to
look at.

If you change Line 34 of our example...

From:

.. literalinclude:: 009.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 34

To:

.. code-block:: python
   
   from circuits import Debugger

   (Pound() + Debugger()).run()

Then run this, you'll get the following::
   
   <Registered[bob:registered] [<Bob/bob 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=2, handlers=2) [S]>, <Pound/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=5, handlers=5) [R]>] {}>
   <Registered[fred:registered] [<Fred/fred 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=2, handlers=2) [S]>, <Pound/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=5, handlers=5) [R]>] {}>
   <Registered[*:registered] [<Debugger/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=1, handlers=1) [S]>, <Pound/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=5, handlers=5) [R]>] {}>
   <Started[*:started] [<Pound/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=5, handlers=5) [R]>, None] {}>
   <Bark[bob:bark] [] {}>
   <Bark[fred:bark] [] {}>
   <Error[*:exception] [<type 'exceptions.NameError'>, NameError("global name 'name' is not defined",), ['  File "/home/prologic/work/circuits/circuits/core/manager.py", line 459, in __handleEvent\n    retval = handler(*eargs, **ekwargs)\n', '  File "source/tutorial/009.py", line 22, in bark\n    print("Woof! I\'m %s!" % name)\n'], <bound method ?.bark of <Bob/bob 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=2, handlers=2) [S]>>] {}>
   ERROR <listener on ('bark',) {target='bob', priority=0.0}> (<type 'exceptions.NameError'>): global name 'name' is not defined
     File "/home/prologic/work/circuits/circuits/core/manager.py", line 459, in __handleEvent
    retval = handler(*eargs, **ekwargs)
     File "source/tutorial/009.py", line 22, in bark
       print("Woof! I'm %s!" % name)
   
   <Error[*:exception] [<type 'exceptions.NameError'>, NameError("global name 'name' is not defined",), ['  File "/home/prologic/work/circuits/circuits/core/manager.py", line 459, in __handleEvent\n    retval = handler(*eargs, **ekwargs)\n', '  File "source/tutorial/009.py", line 22, in bark\n    print("Woof! I\'m %s!" % name)\n'], <bound method ?.bark of <Fred/fred 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=2, handlers=2) [S]>>] {}>
   ERROR <listener on ('bark',) {target='fred', priority=0.0}> (<type 'exceptions.NameError'>): global name 'name' is not defined
     File "/home/prologic/work/circuits/circuits/core/manager.py", line 459, in __handleEvent
       retval = handler(*eargs, **ekwargs)
     File "source/tutorial/009.py", line 22, in bark
       print("Woof! I'm %s!" % name)
   
   ^C<Signal[*:signal] [2, <frame object at 0x808e8ec>] {}>
   <Stopped[*:stopped] [<Pound/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=5, handlers=5) [S]>] {}>
   <Stopped[*:stopped] [<Pound/* 3191:MainThread (queued=0, channels=5, handlers=5) [S]>] {}>
   
You'll notice whereas there was no output before there is now a pretty
detailed output with the ``Debugger`` added to the application. Looking
through the output, we find that the application does indeed start
correctly, but when we fire our ``Bark`` Event it coughs up two exceptions,
one for each of our dogs (``Bob`` and ``Fred``).

From the error we can tell where the error is and roughly where to look in
the code.

.. note::
   You'll notice many other events that are displayed in the above output.
   These are all default events that circuits has builtin which your
   application can respond to. Each builtin Event has a special meaning
   with relation to the state of the application at that point.
   
   See: :py:mod:`circuits.core.events` for detailed documentation regarding
   these events.

The correct code for the ``bark`` Event Handler should be::
   
   def bark(self):
       print("Woof! I'm %s!" % self.name)

Running again with our correction results in the expected output::
   
   Woof! I'm Bob!
   Woof! I'm Fred!

That's it folks!
