Hello World Example -- Test Driven Development
==============================================


This is the classical "Hello World!" style application written in circuits using the `Test Driven Development (TDD) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_ software development process. This example serves as a useful basis for developing your own circuits components and applications that are developed using this process. Furthermore all unit tests in the circuits framework and library of components are all written this way in an almost identical fashion.

This requires the use of:

- `pytest <http://pytest.org>`_

To install pytest:
    
    $ pip install pytest


To run this example:
    
    $ ./hello.py

To run the unit test:
    
    $ py.test test_hello.py
