Welcome to the simple [[http://circuitsweb.com/|circuits.web]] wiki engine in < 100 lines of code!!!!

This little demo wiki makes use of the following software/library:
* [[http://www.python.org|Python]] D'uh :)
* [[http://circuitsweb.com/|circuits.web]] -- web application framework
* [[http://code.google.com/p/creoleparser/|creoleparser]] -- wiki parser
* [[http://sqlite.org|SQLite]] -- wiki database
* [[http://genshi.edgewall.org/|genshi]] -- used by creoleparser and macros
* [[http://pygments.org/|pygments]] -- used by code macro for highlighting

This is the simplest, most concise demonstration of quite a number of the
features of the [[http://circuitsweb.com/|circuits.web]]
web framework as well as the smallest (//without resorting to obfuscation//).

This wiki engine also fully supports macros and a list of available macros
can be found here: [[Macros]]

For help with wiki syntax see the [[CheatSheet]] page.

THe entire source code to this wiki can be found on the
[[http://circuitsframework.com/|circuits]] project home page
here: https://github.com/circuits/circuits/tree/master/examples/web/wiki/

Try the [[SandBox]] :)

**NB**: This circuits.web wiki demo is not a complete wiki engine and lacks
        some rather basic wiki features such as history and recent changes.
        For a more complete wiki engine please see the
        [[http://sahriswiki.org/|sahriswiki]] project.

Enjoy!
